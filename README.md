# VertBot

A Discord bot that I like to put features in every so often. Uses PyCord (before was Discord.py).

## TO-DO LIST  

> Create a weather commands that tells the weather

> Find either a VPS or a mini PC to host the bot 24/7

## CHANGELOG  

2.1.0 (5/28/2024):
* Migrated the codebase from Discord.py to Pycord (might have some bugs)  
* Me back boysssssssss  
 
2.0.0 (3/8/2024):
* Update 2.0! (I skipped like 7 numbers but fuck it we ball)
* Big Update incoming! I'm migrating from using Discord.py to Pycord.
* Mostly everything should be done fixing the needed code to fit Pycord, but some bugs might remain.
* It also allows me to introduce some other features that I found interesting using Pycord. Such as:
* Converted all commands and upcoming commands to 'Slash Commands', meaning they'll show up in Discord's command UI when pressing /
* Slash commands hide your responses, so I'll have to change some commands to account for that.
* [Removed] HelpVert cog as Pycord has its own customizable help page
* [Blackjack] Various fixes
